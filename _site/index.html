At UA Maker, when you demonstrate your understanding once, you are proficient. When you show your understanding repeatedly, you have mastered a skill. </p><p>Students will have the opportunity to learn content and skills in subject area classes and whole school design challenges. Thus, at UA Maker, Mastery means being able to demonstrate repeated proficiency of a particular process, content, or skill as measured by different types of assessments that ask students to apply what they know in different ways when they are ready to demonstrate mastery of a skill. </p><section id="sec-Standards-in-a-Course"><h3><span class="spec-secid" title="link to this section"><a href="#sec-Standards-in-a-Course">6.1</a></span>Standards in a Course</h3><p>We assess our students on the following criteria:						</p><section id="sec-Content-Knowledge-and-Skills"><h4><span class="spec-secid" title="link to this section"><a href="#sec-Content-Knowledge-and-Skills">6.1.1</a></span>Content Knowledge and Skills</h4><p>For every unit there are discrete content knowledge and skills that we expect students to master. These content standards are based on the New York State, Common Core Standards, Industry Standards, and Next Gen Science standards. Content Knowledge and Skills standards shall comprise no less than 65% of the total standards for a course. We assess student acquisition of content knowledge and skills through:</p><ul><li>Performance Tasks </li><li>Problem&#8208;Based or Project&#8208;Based Challenge</li><li>Benchmark Assessments</li><li>Tests and quizzes</li><li>Online learning modules/playlists</li><li>Classwork, discussions, homework</li></ul></section><section id="sec-Design-Thinking"><h4><span class="spec-secid" title="link to this section"><a href="#sec-Design-Thinking">6.1.2</a></span>Design Thinking</h4><p>Central to the work we do at UA Maker is Design Thinking &ndash; students&rsquo; ability to use the design process to create and execute on their ideas, passions, and creativity. In order to assess student on design thinking we use evidence from: Student&rsquo;s performance tasks in every subject area, assessed on the UA Maker Design Thinking Rubric. Assessment of these standards is limited in scope, such that performance on these measures does not primarily determine the course grade. The calculation of scores using these standards is addressed in the Implementation section of this grading policy, but may be modified for individual courses as outlined in the applicable syllabus. Design Thinking Standards shall comprise no less than 10% and no more than 30% of the total standards for a course.</p></section><section id="sec-Success-Strategies"><h4><span class="spec-secid" title="link to this section"><a href="#sec-Success-Strategies">6.1.3</a></span>Success Strategies</h4><p>UA Maker groups non&#8208;content based factors such as professionalism, effort, behavior, participation, and attendance, into an additional school&#8208;wide set of standards called &ldquo;Success Strategies.&rdquo; These standards were developed out of the research gathered by the NYCDOE on Academic and Personal Learning Behaviors. In addition to all that our students know and are able to do, we also offer our students feedback on the habits and behaviors that help students to succeed in school and beyond. Students receive feedback and areas to work on and improve based on their behaviors throughout their classes. It is important that all teachers explicitly support student development in the areas of academic and personal behaviors by clearly stating expectations and providing actionable feedback over the course of a unit. Success Strategy standards shall comprise no less than 10% and no more than 30% of the total standards for a course. Assessment of these standards is limited in scope, such that performance on these measures does not primarily determine the course grade. The calculation of scores using these standards is addressed in the Implementation section of this grading policy, but may be modified for individual courses as outlined in the applicable syllabus.</p><p>At UA Maker, the year is divided into four marking periods. Families recieve a copy of student grades at the end of each marking period. </p></section></section><section id="sec-Mastery-Based-Grading"><h3><span class="spec-secid" title="link to this section"><a href="#sec-Mastery-Based-Grading">6.2</a></span>Mastery Based Grading</h3><p>Courses at UA Maker are designed so that students may develop and demonstrate their mastery of concepts and skills through multiple measures of performance. These measures include Performance Tasks, AtBats, classwork, projects and assignments, homework, and other methods of formative and summative assessment as designed by the individual course teacher.</p><p>A substantial majority of grades at UA Maker are based on the individual students&rsquo; mastery of course content, and are not based on completion of assignments alone. </p><p>Each course has a collection of standards which represent the required knowledge, content, and skills, which a student must master in order to pass the course and earn credit. Students are provided with a minimum of three opportunities to demonstrate their competancy for each of the standards within the course as part of formal AtBat assessments. To pass a course and recieve credit, a student must demonstrate an acceptable level of mastery for a minimum of 65% of the course standards, as described in the implementation section of this grading policy.</p><div class="spec-todo">DISCUSS GRADE CALCULATION AND DECAYING AVERAGE</div><p>Mastery of any standard is calculated by taking a simplified decaying average of the assignments aligned to that standard.</p><p>The Decaying Average calculation factors the average of all assessment items aligned to a particular standard while weighing the most recent (current) item at a higher percentage. The term decaying average is traditionally used to describe a complex analysis: when an additional assessment is applied to an existing value, the prior decaying average is used to calculate the new decaying average. This method weights all assessments equally and calculates the average of learning over time. However, our method uses a simplified approach where we calculate the average of all prior assessments and applies the value as a weighted percentage formula, instead of the alternative approach of simply using the prior decaying average. Our decaying average is set at 65/35, meaning the current item is weighted at 65%, and the average of all other scores for that standard is weighted at 35%. Note that the average is rounded to the next two decimals. If there is only one result, then the single score will be displayed. For example, a student has four aligned items with scores of 4, 3, 2, and 5 (scores listed chronologically from oldest to most recent). If the current item is set to be weighted at 75% of mastery, prior scores are weighted at 25%: Current item score: 5 Average of prior item scores: (4 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 3 Calculated score: 5 (.75) + 3 (.25) = 3.75 + .75 = 4.5</p></section><section id="sec-Regents-Exams"><h3><span class="spec-secid" title="link to this section"><a href="#sec-Regents-Exams">6.3</a></span>Regents Exams</h3><p>For all courses which terminate in a regents examination, the classroom teacher has the discretion to establish through the course syllabus whether and how the exam score will be integrated in the final grade for the course. The option to incorporate regents examination scores must comply with all of the following conditions:</p><ul><li><strong>The exam may account for no more than 33% of the course grade</strong></li></ul><p>The classroom teacher has the option to comply with this limitation either by:</p><ol><li>Applying the regents exam as one AtBat score with each applicable course standard attached, or</li><li>Accepting the regents exam score as satisfactory demonstration of Mastery in up to 33% of the course standards, applied as three AtBats using the following format:</li></ol><p><code>**Regents Exam - Part 1</code>, <code>**Regents Exam - Part 2</code>, <code>**Regents Exam - Part 3</code></p><p>Thereby allowing the regents score to be calculated as Mastery of the applicable standards, while counting for no more than the maximum 33% of the final course grade.</p><ul><li><strong>The exam may not be the only reason that a student passes or fails the course</strong></li></ul><p>The use of the exam score must be calculated into the course grade as one component of the weighted average score (for example, calculated as 20% of the final score). Courses which are not compatible with this approach may use either of the strategies outlined above to incorporate exam scores using AtBats. The classroom teacher must ensure that the inclusion of the exam score does not allow a student who has failed to demonstrate mastery in a majority of course standard to pass the course.</p><ul><li><strong>The actual exam score of each student must be used as the basis for any change in their course grade</strong></li></ul><p>Classroom teachers may not, for example, add a set number of bonus points to the grade of all students who completed the exam. They may establish through the course syllabus, for example, that the exam score shall be calculated as 20% of the final grade</p><ul><li><strong>The way that the regents examination score will be used as part of the course grade must be outlined as part of the course syllabus</strong></li><li><strong>The use of the examination scores must be applied equally and uniformly to all students undertaking the course</strong></li></ul><p>The method of calculation outlined by the syllabus must be applied fairly and equallty to all students, except in cases where a student did not sit the examination or where inclusion of the exam score would violate any of the conditions above. In cases where the classroom teacher feels that the application of the policy outlined by their syllabus would result in a final grade that does not accurately reflect a students&rsquo; mastery of the course material, the teacher should consult with administration and document evidence in support of their opinion. In the event that individual accomodations are made to ensure accurate grades, this evidence must be retained on file.</p><div class="spec-note">The DOE has provided some <a href="https://intranet.nycboe.net/NR/rdonlyres/3CA1EF95-A5FA-4638-9853-CB8CC5A44C9C/0/Acpolicygradingpolicy.pdf">examples of how the Regents score may be calculated as part of the final course grade</a></div><section id="sec-Credit-by-Examination"><h4><span class="spec-secid" title="link to this section"><a href="#sec-Credit-by-Examination">6.3.1</a></span>Credit by Examination</h4><p>Students may earn up to two credits per exam subject through credit&#8208;by&#8208;examination, where the student has attained a score of 85 or above on the corresponding Regents exam.

The purpose of a course extension is to allow students to continue their study so that they may demonstrate sufficient mastery of the course to earn a credit.</p><p>All UA Maker courses are instructionally annualized, meaning that they are designed for students to achieve mastery in their standards through a 10 month learning cycle. In some cases, courses meet only in the Fall semester. Most students will achieve mastery of standards during that term, however, students may continue to work with their teachers in after school sessions or by completing tasks assigned in Canvas through the rest of the year.
