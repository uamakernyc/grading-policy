# Implementation

## Multiple Grading Policies

This school-wide grading policy represents the standard procedure for the calculation and awarding of grades at UA Maker.

In order to preserve flexibility for modifications to the school wide grading policy, additional grading policies may be established either at the department, grade, or course level, provided that the alternate policy apply equally to all students within the impacted department, grade, or course. In circumstances where additional grading policies are established, they must be made available to all impacted students and families. At the course level, grading policies should be established as part of the syllabus, and made available to students at the beginning of the course.

Grading policies modifying the school-wide grading policy may only be established when all of the following conditions are met:

* The teacher seeking to establish the alternate policy must consult with the principal or their designee and recieve their approval
* The alternate policy must be in full compliance with academic policy set forth by the Department of Education
* The policy must be published and made widely available at the beginning of the term in which the policy shall take effect
* The policy must explain:
  1. When students recieve grades
  2. How courses are graded
  3. How mastery is measured
  4. The scale of marks used by the deparment, grade level, or course

## Implementing Mastery Based Grading to Physical Education

In accordance with DOE Academic policy, student grades are primarily determined by mastery of course content and skills for all courses at UA Maker. Non-mastery measures, represented by the Success Strategies collection of standards, are not used as a determining factor in the success of students for any particular course.

Applying these principles to Physical Education, gym classes at UA Maker require students to demonstrate mastery of the collection of standards made available through Canvas at the beginning of the term. Gym classes are not graded solely on attendance, participation, or preparedness. Students' demonstration of these non-mastery factors contributes to their grades.

The NYC FITNESSGRAM may be used in support of students' mastery of the course standards, however, improvement in FITNESSGRAM scores is not a factor in determining student grades.

## Availability of the grading policy

The current school-wide grading policy is available on the school website at [http://dev.uamaker.nyc/grading-policy](http://dev.uamaker.nyc/grading-policy).

## Updating the grading policy

Any person is free to contribute suggestions for changes to the grading policy (updates, error correction, modification or other). Throughout the school year, suggestions and contributions from staff, families, students, and any other source will be collected and considered for the following year. During the summer term, opportunities shall be provided for staff to discuss these changes, with the final determination of the grading policy to be at the discretion of the principal with consultation from teachers and families.

Any changes to the grading policy will not take effect until a new version is published at the beginning of the following academic year.

Any person wishing to provide feedback, contributions, or suggestions should consult the Contributions section above.
