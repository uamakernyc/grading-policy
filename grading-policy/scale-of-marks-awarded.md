# Scale of Marks Awarded

UA Maker provides grade feedback to students based on a six point scale of grades, which are converted to their numeric equivalents prior to being recorded in STARS. Wherever possible, classroom teachers provide feedback to students based on their mastery of course concepts and skills without relying on numeric feedback. At the end of each of four marking periods, students and families recieve interim grades as they appear in STARS to ensure transparency around student progress.

The grade feedback that students will recieve most frequently as part of their studies are:

| Title               | Shortcode | Grade | Numeric Equivalent |
|:-------------------:|:---------:|:-----:|:------------------:|
| Missing             |`MISSING`  | M     | 0 |
| Beginner            |`B`        | 1     | < 65 |
| Advanced Beginner   |`AB`       | 2     | < 65 |
| Emerging Proficient |`EP`       | 3     | 65 - 80 |
| Proficient          |`P`        | 4     | 81 - 95 |
| Advanced Proficient |`AP`       | 5     | 96 - 100 |


The values listed for "Grade" above are used in the calculation of decaying average as part of the formula to determine students' mastery of standards.

## Numeric Grade Scale

Most courses at UA Maker use the Numeric Grade scale (1 - 100) to report student grades at the end of each marking period, including final grades at the conclusion of the term. Scores of 1 - 64 equate to a failing grade, and scores 65 - 100 equate to a passing grade resulting in the accumulation of credit toward graduation. A score of 65 is the lowest possible passing score.

Generally, a student who attended the course but failed to successfully demonstrate their mastery of the content and skills, who did not qualify for grades outlined below, will receive a score of 55.

## Pass / Fail Scale

Non-credit bearing courses have their final grades reported using the Pass / Fail grading scale. `P`, "Pass", is recorded on the student transcript indicating their successful completion of the course. `F`, "Fail", is recorded in circumstances where the student was not able to meet the criteria to pass.

## Mastery Based Grading Scale

A small number of courses at UA Maker may be selected to test the Mastery Based Grading Scale as outlined below. Such courses shall clearly indicate the scale of marks used as part of the syllabus.

| Course Mark | Description                     | Numeric Equivalent | Pass/Fail Equivalent |
|-------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
|`ME`         | Mastery - Exceeds standards     | 95                 | P                    |
|`MA`         | Mastery - Above standards       | 85                 | P                    |
|`MT`         | Mastery - Meets standards       | 75                 | P                    |
|`MP`         | Mastery - Approaching standards | 65                 | P                    |
|`MB`         | Mastery - Below standards       | 55                 | F                    |

## Other Grades

### Fulfilled Distribution Requirement (ND)

`ND` is the grade assigned to students when, through participation in an integrated course, they have sucessfully met a distribution requirement for purposes of progress toward graduation. UA Maker offers a variety of integrated courses, identified as such within the applicable course syllabus.

### Course Extension and Audit (NU)

`NU` is a grade assigned to students who have successfully applied for a course extension based on the school course extension policy, and have subsequently completed a Course Extension Agreement. Following the assignment of this grade, students are enrolled in new course codes during Term 7 (summer), and are permitted to complete and submit the remaining course requirements in order to demonstrate their competency in the course content. These course codes are identified through the use of `E` in the seventh code position. Students earn credit through this process as applicable through the course extension process.

Note: A student enrolled in Algebra, `MEN11`, needs additional time to demonstrate mastery of the course content and successfully applies for a course extension with the help of their advisor. The student completes the Course Extension Agreement and receives a grade of `NU` in `MEN11`, and is enrolled in `MEN11QE`. The student continues to work on the course content during Term 7. After three weeks, the student has successfully attained a passing grade as a result of demonstrating mastery of the course content, and receives the applicable grade and credit for `MEN11QE`.

#### Distinguishing between Course Extensions and Targeted Credit Recovery

The course extension procedure in place at UA Maker has been established in acknowledgement that, due to differences in the pace of learning of individual students, some students benefit from additional time and support in order to achieve mastery in the content of the course. Our Mastery Based learning model is intended to support the differences between students and to enable them, as much as possible, to learn and grow through high quality instruction and at their own unique pace.

These goals are supported by our school wide annualized instructional approach and our use of a variety of course content delivery mechanisms.

Targeted Credit Recovery, designated by the letter `R` in the seventh code position, is not in use at UA Maker and supports a different need- where students require intensive supplementary instruction in order to achieve passing status. In these circumstances and wherever possible, UA Maker provides students with opportunities to repeat course content using "Selective" versions of courses to avoid the repetition of circumstances identical to those under which the student was not able to be successful on their initial attempt.

Course Extensions, designated by the letter `E` in the seventh code position, are the process that we have defined in order to provide students who have met rigorous eligibility criteria with additional time during the summer term in which to continue, uninterrupted and without repetition, the learning that they have undertaken during the spring term in order to achieve passing status in the course and earn applicable credit.


### Incomplete (NX)

In extenuating, documented circumstances (such as a death in the family, surgery), students may receive a grade of Incomplete (appears as `NX` on their transcript). A student may make an explicit application for an Incomplete grade as part of the Course Extension Application Process. The students advisor or any staff member may also initiate such an application on behalf of the student.

A student who has been determined to be eligible for a grade of Incomplete will be provided with a letter outlining the conditions of the `NX` grade. Both the student and their advisor must sign this letter prior to the grade being assigned to the student by the programming chair.

A student who has been awarded a grade of Incomplete must successfully complete the remaining course requirements by the end of the term following the termination of the course in order to recieve a final grade and credit, as applicable. `NX` does not have a pass/fail or numeric equivalent.

### New or Recently Admitted Students (NL)

Students who enroll in a course after it has started may have missed assignments or assessments needed to generate a complete course grade for a given marking period. These students may be given a grade of `NL` in STARS to indicate this circumstance. ‘NL’ does not have a pass/fail or numeric equivalent. Students who receive a mark of `NL` must successfully complete remaining course requirements by the end of the term following the termination of the course in order to receive a final grade and credit, as applicable.

A student may use their status as a New or Recently Admitted Student in support of their application for a course extension. Each student's advisor, or any member of staff, may initiate such an application on behalf of the student.

A student who has been determined to be eligible for a grade of Incomplete will be provided with a letter outlining the conditions of the `NL` grade. Both the student and their advisor must sign this letter prior to the grade being assigned to the student by the programming chair.

### No Show (NS)

A grade of `NS` is given to a student who fails to attend a course and does not participate in any of the work from which a grade can be derived. `NS` has a pass/fail equivalent of fail and a default numeric equivalent of 45. 

This mark is used in egregious situations, when students have been given reasonable chances to make up missed work and their absences are so chronic that only a failing mark is appropriate. Classroom teachers may award this grade in consultation with the Admin team where both the following conditions are met:

* The student has not completed any graded coursework
* The students course attendance rate is 60% or less

### Course Waived (NW)

Used to waive incomplete gym credit requirements where the student has completed all other graduation requirements. Equivalent to a Pass.

### Long-term absenteeism and Home and Hospital Instruction

Where possible, instead of giving failing grades, long-term absentees (LTA) shall be discharged appropriately. Similarly, students who are on home and hospital instruction shall not receive `NS` marks.
