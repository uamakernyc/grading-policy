### Course Extension and Audit (NU)


### Incomplete (NX)

In extenuating, documented circumstances (such as a death in the family, surgery), students may receive a grade of Incomplete (appears as "NX" on their transcript). A student may make an explicit application for an Incomplete grade as part of the Course Extension Application Process. The students advisor or any staff member may also initiate such an application on behalf of the student.

A student who has been determined to be eligible for a grade of Incomplete will be provided with a letter outlining the conditions of the "NX" grade. Both the student and their advisor must sign this letter prior to the grade being assigned to the student by the programming chair.

A student who has been awarded a grade of Incomplete must successfully complete the remaining course requirements by the end of the term following the termination of the course in order to recieve a final grade and credit, as applicable. "NX" does not have a pass/fail or numeric equivalent.

### New or Recently Admitted Students (NL)

Students who enroll in a course after it has started may have missed assignments or assessments needed to generate a complete course grade for a given marking period. These students may be given a grade of ‘NL’ in STARS to indicate this circumstance. ‘NL’ does not have a pass/fail or numeric equivalent. Students who receive a mark of ‘NL’ must successfully complete remaining course requirements by the end of the term following the termination of the course in order to receive a final grade and credit, as applicable.

A student may use their status as a New or Recently Admitted Student in support of their application for a course extension. Each student's advisor, or any member of staff, may initiate such an application on behalf of the student.

A student who has been determined to be eligible for a grade of Incomplete will be provided with a letter outlining the conditions of the "NL" grade. Both the student and their advisor must sign this letter prior to the grade being assigned to the student by the programming chair.

### No Show (NS)

A grade of ‘NS’ is given to a student who fails to attend a course and does not participate in any of the work from which a grade can be derived. ‘NS’ has a pass/fail equivalent of fail and a default numeric equivalent of 45. 

This mark is used in egregious situations, when students have been given reasonable chances to make up missed work and their absences are so chronic that only a failing mark is appropriate. Classroom teachers may award this grade in consultation with the Admin team where both the following conditions are met:

* The student has not completed any graded coursework
* The students attendance rate, as measured by their Kinvolved record for the class, is 60% or less

### Long-term absentism and Home and Hospistal Instruction

Where possible, instead of giving failing grades, long-term absentees (LTA) shall be discharged appropriately. Similarly, students who are on home and hospital instruction shall not receive ‘NS’ marks.
