## When and how a grade can be changed after it has been finalized

Grades in STARS are finalized four weeks following the end of the term, and are finalized after that deadline has passed. As courses at UA Maker are designed to adhere to an annualized instructional approach, the applicable deadline falls approximately four weeks after the conclusion of classes at the end of the school year.

Grades may be changed after this deadline only by a member of the school administration or the programming chair, and only at the direction of the principal. The principal shall direct retroactive changes to student grades only during the following circumstances:

* An error was made in the calculation or entry of a grade
* A grade update must be made after the completion of outstanding coursework, replacing `NX` (incomplete) or `NL` (recent admit), no later than the end of the term following the grade (Term 7)
* In the event of a Principal Override, in accordance with CSA and UFT contracts

### Annualization Updates

Courses at UA Maker are instructionally annualized, designed to accomodate students in demonstrating mastery of course content and skills throuough a 36 week learning cycle, and coded in STARS using `N` in the third character, indicating annual course duration with transcript grades posted once per year.

Some courses at UA Maker meet predominantly during either the fall or spring semester. Learning activities and opportunities to demonstrate enhanced mastery are spiraled throughout the year. Classroom teachers use school-wide activities as opportunities to improve the accuracy of the grades and feedback provided to students.

As a result of this year long term model, grades are finalized for all courses four weeks after the conclusion of classes at the end of the spring semester. Annualization updates are not generally used as a process to document the growing mastery of students, which is captured instead by the interim grades delivered to students and families at the conclusion of each of the four marking periods, and which more accurately reports the narrative of students' growth in each course.
