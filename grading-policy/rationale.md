# Rationale for Mastery Based Learning

Grades at UA Maker provide precise, actionable feedback about students’ ability to master a course’s standards (NYS, Common Core, Next Gen, Design Thinking, and Success Strategies).

Since the rapidly changing workplace calls for our future Makers to apply what they know and are able to do in novel situations and with independence, students at UA Maker have demonstrated mastery when they show their understanding on their own, across time and varying situations. At UA Maker, when you demonstrate your understanding once, you are proficient. When you show your understanding repeatedly, you have mastered a skill. 

Students will have the opportunity to learn content and skills in subject area classes and whole school design challenges. Thus, at UA Maker, Mastery means being able to demonstrate repeated proficiency of a particular process, content, or skill as measured by different types of assessments that ask students to apply what they know in different ways when they are ready to demonstrate mastery of a skill. 
We assess our students on the following criteria:						

####Design Thinking 
Central to the work we do at UA Maker is Design Thinking – students’ ability to use the design process to create and execute on their ideas, passions, and creativity. In order to assess student on design thinking we use evidence from:
Student’s performance tasks in every subject area, assessed on the UA Maker Design Thinking Rubric

####Content Knowledge and Skills
For every unit there are discrete content knowledge and skills that we expect students to master. These content standards are based on the New York State, Common Core Standards, Industry Standards, and Next Gen Science standards. 
We assess students through:

####Performance Tasks 
-Problem-Based  or Project-Based Challenge
- Benchmark Assessments
-Tests and quizzes
-Online learning modules/playlists
-Classwork, discussions, homework


####Success Strategies
In addition to all that our students know and are able to do, we also offer our students feedback on the habits and behaviors that help students to succeed in school and beyond. 

Students receive feedback and areas to work on and improve based on their behaviors throughout their classes.

It is important that all teachers explicitly support student development in the areas of academic and personal behaviors by clearly stating expectations and providing actionable feedback over the course of a unit.
