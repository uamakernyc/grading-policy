Mastery Based Grading Policy

Grading Policy (70% Projects 30% A&PB?)
Process for course extensions
Going to annualized
Will give scores periodically, but don’t have to award credit.
Credit awarded at the end of the year
At a semester course, credit awarded at end of year
They have through Term 7 to earn credit if not met in June
If a course ends at the end of a semester
Students who have an extension they would have one term to complete an extension
NEXT STEP: Create a google form that creates extension paperwork
Form should include space for student/advisor to document extenuating circumstances that may make them eligible for an extension despite not meeting average
Extension requirements: Decaying Average 2 on 65% of course standards, signed off by course extension committee comprised of lead teacher, member of administration by June 1.
Course extension approval or denial is given to student between June 1-June 7
Student and Advisor complete course extension request form by May 15 of each year
Credit available for college courses / independant study, etc.
Schools may determine whether to establish school-based policies for class rankings and determinations of a valedictorian and salutatorian. Schools should have clear, documented policies in these areas that take into consideration which students are eligible to be ranked, which courses count in the ranking, how courses are weighted, and how the final rank will be calculated.

Grade improvement policy (from physics)
Purpose: To shift focus from task completion to mastery of standards, support students in reflecting on mastery and using rubrics to produce higher quality work, and to develop more awareness of deadlines to increase urgency throughout the year.

Policy Description:
When submitting revisions to previously graded work, students must submit a grade improvement form either on paper or digitally stating the standard, a claim for the requested rubric level for each standard, and evidence to support the claim. 
If submitting work more than 1 week past the deadline posted on Canvas, students must also submit the grade improvement form.

Expectations of Teachers:
Have grade improvement form available to students on paper or digitally (draft of a potential google form version).
Require students to submit an improvement form before entering grade changes on Canvas for revised or late work.
Include due dates on Canvas assignments.
Make rubrics available to students on Canvas and/or on paper performance tasks. 


Grades at UA Maker provide precise, actionable feedback about students’ ability to master a course’s standards (NYS, Common Core, Next Gen, Design Thinking, and Academic & Personal Behaviors).

Since the rapidly changing workplace calls for our future Makers to apply what they know and are able to do in novel situations and with independence, students at UA Maker have demonstrated mastery when they show their understanding on their own, across time and situations. At UA Maker, when you demonstrate your understanding once, you are proficient. When you show your understanding repeatedly, you have mastered a skill. 

Students will have the opportunity to learn content and skills in subject area classes and whole school design challenges. Thus, at UA Maker, Mastery means being able to demonstrate repeated proficiency of a particular process, content, or skill as measured by different types of assessments that ask students to apply what they know in different ways when they are ready to demonstrate mastery of a skill. 

We assess our students on the following criteria:						

Design Thinking 
Central to the work we do at UA Maker is Design Thinking – students’ ability to use the design process to create and execute on their ideas, passions, and creativity. In order to assess student on design thinking we use evidence from:
Student’s performance tasks in every subject area, assessed on the UA Maker Design Thinking Rubric

Content Knowledge and Skills
For every unit there are discrete content knowledge and skills that we expect students to master. These content standards are based on the New York State, Common Core Standards, Industry Standards, and Next Gen Science standards. 
We assess students through:

Performance Tasks 
Problem-Based  or Project-Based Challenge
Benchmark Assessments
Tests and quizzes
Online learning modules/playlists
Classwork, discussions, homework


Academic and Personal Behaviors
In addition to all that our students know and are able to do, we also offer our students feedback on the habits and behaviors that help students to succeed in school and beyond. 

Students receive feedback and areas to work on and improve based on their behaviors throughout their classes.

It is important that all teachers explicitly support student development in the areas of academic and personal behaviors by clearly stating expectations and providing actionable feedback over the course of a unit. 



Definitions

“Proficiency” represents a high standard of performance that serves as a “cut point” or score on
a given assessment, whether as a number/percent correct or as a specific level on a rubric. A
proficiency score may be exceeded by an “advanced” score.

“Mastery” implies that proficiency has been demonstrated multiple times and in multiple ways or
contexts.

“Asynchronous”means that students are not working at the same time as others.

“Personalization” means that students can work at different paces and may not be working on the same work as others.
“At Bat” means a student assessment

A rubric is a scoring guide that describes levels of performance along a continuum, (“beginner”
“advanced beginner” “emerging proficient” “proficient” “advanced proficient”) and may be supplemented by a specific set of indicators for each level and competency being assessed that are in some cases specific to the performance task. Please find an example of a rubric below:

Earning Credit at UA Maker

Our Mastery Framework will allow students to have multiple opportunities to show proficiency of a particular standard. When students have showed a repeated level of proficiency we state that they have mastered a standard. Like a skill, mastering a standard means the student can demonstrate proficiency of a skill at various intervals and at varying degrees of difficulty.  When a student does not show proficiency of a standard, the student loses credit for that standard until they can demonstrate that they can do it with high fidelity. While we want for all students to be accelerating towards mastery, it is not necessary to master all standards in order to earn a credit at UA Maker. For instance, in a traditional school a student could earn a credit for earning a 65%, well below the label of mastery. Likewise, at UA Maker, in order for students to earn a credit, they do not need to be scoring a 4 (proficient) or 5 (advanced proficient) on one of our rubrics. Those that do score at levels of mastery will qualify for Honor Roll and Principal’s Honor Roll.

While all of our scores are on a 1-5 scale, we do calculate a converted numeric grade (on a 1-100 scale) for student transcripts. Students at UA Maker can earn an 80 by scoring a 3 or higher on 100% of a course’s standards. A student can earn a 90 by scoring a 4 or higher on 100% of a course’s standards. A minimum passing score would be when a student has scored a level 3 (emerging proficient) on 65% of the standards in a course. Our school also uses the mark NU as a placeholder for various reporting purposes (see the following sections).

To have a valid assessment of a student’s ability they need to have have multiple opportunities (at bats) to demonstrate their proficiency. Students must have at least 3 at bats for every standard that will be assessed. We believe that 3 at bats is the minimum reasonable number of activities, assignments, quizzes, debates, presentations, etc, to assess a student’s development.  

Annualized Courses 
We are semester based school and we give grades 2 times a year, however, the following courses follow an annualized instructional model where final grades are awarded at the end of the year. 

Annualized Instructional Model
US History
English 
Global History
Living Environment
Earth Science
CC Algebra
CC Geometry
CC Algebra 2



In order to accommodate this instructional model in STARS, we will use an NU as a placeholder grade for these courses at the end of term 1 if a student has yet to master enough standards to earn a credit. Students that receive an NU in term 1 of an annualized instructional model course will be dually enrolled in both the original course (with the same course code) as well as the next course in the sequence the following term. For example, a student might receive an NU in the first term of a Living Environment course coded SLS21 where they receive a mark of NU. In term 2 they will be dually enrolled in SLS22 during the regular school day and in SLS21 during a zero period. At the conclusion of the school year the same final grade will be awarded in both courses, earning the student 2 credits. 

Students in an annualized instructional model course may receive a course extension at the end of the second term of the course allowing them to continue their study for one term (most likely summer term 7). This would allow them to earn 2 credits at the end of the summer term 7.

Semester Courses 
The following courses are semester courses and will have credits awarded at the end of the semester.

Semester Instructional Model
Health
Theatre
Art
Computer Science
Digital Media
Economics

Students in a semester course may receive a course extension at the end of the semester allowing them to continue their study for one term. Students would be given a score of NU and then programmed again for this course in STARS during the following semester during zero period.

Course Extensions
Course extensions are given to qualifying students allowing them to continue their study when they have not yet mastered enough standards to earn a credit. A panel including a teacher, principal, and student will determine whether a course extension is appropriate and fill out a course extension form. Criteria to be awarded a course extension include;

65% attendance minimum in course being extended
Have mastered at least 40% of the course standards
A completed course extension form stating which standards still need to be mastered
