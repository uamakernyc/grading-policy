# How Courses are Graded

Grades at UA Maker provide precise, actionable feedback about students’ ability to master a course’s standards (NYS, Common Core, Next Gen, Design Thinking, and Academic & Personal Behaviors).

Since the rapidly changing workplace calls for our future Makers to apply what they know and are able to do in novel situations and with independence, students at UA Maker have demonstrated mastery when they show their understanding on their own, across time and situations. At UA Maker, when you demonstrate your understanding once, you are proficient. When you show your understanding repeatedly, you have mastered a skill. 

Students will have the opportunity to learn content and skills in subject area classes and whole school design challenges. Thus, at UA Maker, Mastery means being able to demonstrate repeated proficiency of a particular process, content, or skill as measured by different types of assessments that ask students to apply what they know in different ways when they are ready to demonstrate mastery of a skill. 

We assess our students on the following criteria:						

####Content Knowledge and Skills
For every unit there are discrete content knowledge and skills that we expect students to master. These content standards are based on the New York State, Common Core Standards, Industry Standards, and Next Gen Science standards. 
Content Knowledge and Skills standards shall comprise no less than 65% of the total standards for a course.
We assess student acquisition of content knowledge and skills through:

  *Performance Tasks 
  *Problem-Based  or Project-Based Challenge
  *Benchmark Assessments
  *Tests and quizzes
  *Online learning modules/playlists
  *Classwork, discussions, homework

####Design Thinking 
Central to the work we do at UA Maker is Design Thinking – students’ ability to use the design process to create and execute on their ideas, passions, and creativity. In order to assess student on design thinking we use evidence from:
Student’s performance tasks in every subject area, assessed on the UA Maker Design Thinking Rubric. Assessment of these standards is limited in scope, such that performance on these measures does not primarily determine the course grade. The calculation of scores using these standards is addressed in the Implementation section of this grading policy, but may be modified for individual courses as outlined in the applicable syllabus.
Design Thinking Standards shall comprise no less than 10% and no more than 30% of the total standards for a course.

####Success Strategies

UA Maker groups non‐content based factors such as professionalism, effort, behavior, participation, and attendance, into an additional school‐wide set of standards called “Success Strategies.”  These standards were developed out of the research gathered by the NYCDOE on Academic and Personal Learning Behaviors. In addition to all that our students know and are able to do, we also offer our students feedback on the habits and behaviors that help students to succeed in school and beyond. Students receive feedback and areas to work on and improve based on their behaviors throughout their classes. It is important that all teachers explicitly support student development in the areas of academic and personal behaviors by clearly stating expectations and providing actionable feedback over the course of a unit. 
Success Strategy standards shall comprise no less than 10% and no more than 30% of the total standards for a course.  Assessment of these standards is limited in scope, such that performance on these measures does not primarily determine the course grade. The calculation of scores using these standards is addressed in the Implementation section of this grading policy, but may be modified for individual courses as outlined in the applicable syllabus.

At UA Maker, the year is divided into four marking periods. Families recieve a copy of student grades at the end of each marking period. 

## Mastery Based Grading

Courses at UA Maker are designed so that students may develop and demonstrate their mastery of concepts and skills through multiple measures of performance. These measures include Performance Tasks, AtBats, classwork, projects and assignments, homework, and other methods of formative and summative assessment as designed by the individual course teacher.

A substantial majority of grades at UA Maker are based on the individual students' mastery of course content, and are not based on completion of assignments alone. 

Each course has a collection of standards which represent the required knowledge, content, and skills, which a student must master in order to pass the course and earn credit. Students are provided with a minimum of three opportunities to demonstrate their competancy for each of the standards within the course as part of formal AtBat assessments. To pass a course and recieve credit, a student must demonstrate an acceptable level of mastery for a minimum of 65% of the course standards, as described in the implementation section of this grading policy.

## Standards in a Course

Courses are made up of content standards, design thinking standards, and success strategy standards.

## Regents Exams

For all courses which terminate in a regents examination, the classroom teacher has the discretion to establish through the course syllabus whether and how the exam score will be integrated in the final grade for the course. The option to incorporate regents examination scores must comply with all of the following conditions:

* **The exam may account for no more than 33% of the course grade**

The classroom teacher has the option to comply with this limitation either by:

  1. Applying the regents exam as one AtBat score with each applicable course standard attached, or

  2. Accepting the regents exam score as satisfactory demonstration of Mastery in up to 33% of the course standards, applied as three AtBats using the following format:

`**Regents Exam - Part 1`, `**Regents Exam - Part 2`, `**Regents Exam - Part 3`

Thereby allowing the regents score to be calculated as Mastery of the applicable standards, while counting for no more than the maximum 33% of the final course grade.

* **The exam may not be the only reason that a student passes or fails the course**

The use of the exam score must be calculated into the course grade as one component of the weighted average score (for example, calculated as 20% of the final score). Courses which are not compatible with this approach may use either of the strategies outlined above to incorporate exam scores using AtBats. The classroom teacher must ensure that the inclusion of the exam score does not allow a student who has failed to demonstrate mastery in a majority of course standard to pass the course.

* **The actual exam score of each student must be used as the basis for any change in their course grade**

Classroom teachers may not, for example, add a set number of bonus points to the grade of all students who completed the exam. They may establish through the course syllabus, for example, that the exam score shall be calculated as 20% of the final grade

* **The way that the regents examination score will be used as part of the course grade must be outlined as part of the course syllabus**

* **The use of the examination scores must be applied equally and uniformly to all students undertaking the course**

The method of calculation outlined by the syllabus must be applied fairly and equallty to all students, except in cases where a student did not sit the examination or where inclusion of the exam score would violate any of the conditions above. In cases where the classroom teacher feels that the application of the policy outlined by their syllabus would result in a final grade that does not accurately reflect a students' mastery of the course material, the teacher should consult with administration and document evidence in support of their opinion. In the event that individual accomodations are made to ensure accurate grades, this evidence must be retained on file.

NOTE: The DOE has provided some [examples of how the Regents score may be calculated as part of the final course grade](https://intranet.nycboe.net/NR/rdonlyres/3CA1EF95-A5FA-4638-9853-CB8CC5A44C9C/0/Acpolicygradingpolicy.pdf)

### Credit by Examination

Students may earn up to two credits per exam subject through credit-by-examination, where the student has attained a score of 85 or above on the corresponding Regents exam. Students may earn up to a total of 13 credits without completing units of study, where all of the following criteria are met:

* The student has not previously attempted, and failed, the course for which they are attempting to gain credit-by-examination
* The high school superintendent or their designee determines that the student will benefit academically by exercising this alternative
* The principal determines that the student successfully completed an oral examination or special project demonstrating proficiency of the subject matter developed in the course but not measured by the relevant exams
* Students attempting to earn credit-by-examination in science have completed the compulsory labratory component with passing status and documented labratory reports

Students may not use an ELA Regents exam, taken in 11th grade, to give credit for 12th grade ELA courses which would otherwide be completed after the ELA Regents exam.

Credit-by-examination is not available for Languages other than English (LOTE) subjects. 

## Determination of Promotion in Doubt

In January of each year, students facing substantial risk of accumulating insufficient credit to be promoted to the next grade shall be identified and their families advised in writing no later than the second week of February.

In determining substantial risk, the administration and staff shall consider:

* The students overall progress toward sufficient Mastery of course standards
* Whether, in the opinion of the classroom teacher, the student is expected to attain mastery and recieve applicable credit

## Make up assignments and missed work

Students may have the opporunity to complete make up assignments, either to improve their initial score in response to feedback from the course teacher, or to earn a score for assignments that have been missed.

If a student is given the opportunity to complete make up assignments or missed work, all work must be completed, submitted, and graded within the same term, no later than four weeks after the end of the final marking period. Classroom teachers must establish clear deadlines with students undertaking this work which will ensure that all assignments may be graded to meet this deadline.

###Grade improvement forms
When submitting revisions to previously graded work, students must submit a grade improvement form either on paper or digitally stating the standard, a claim for the requested rubric level for each standard, and evidence to support the claim. 
If submitting work more than 1 week past the deadline posted on Canvas, students must also submit the grade improvement form.

Teachers must have grade improvement form available to students on paper or digitally (draft of a potential google form version).
Teachers must require students to submit an improvement form before entering grade changes on Canvas for revised or late work.Teachers must include due dates on Canvas assignments. Teachers must make rubrics available to students on Canvas and/or on paper performance tasks.

### Excused Absenses

When a student has missed work as a result of documented excusable absence (for example, a doctors appointment), classroom teachers shall provide the opportunity for students to submit the work.

### Unexcused Absenses

Students missing work as a result of unexcused absences shall be provided with opportunities to submit work at the discretion of the classroom teacher. In cases where the classroom teacher agrees to offer the opportunity to submit work, the teacher shall clearly establish a deadline with the student and ensure the student has access to the materials required to complete the work. The teacher has the option of allowing the student to submit the missed assignment, or providing a modified assignment which addresses, at least, the same standards as the original missed work.

Using this option, teachers are able to provide students with an opportunity to demonstrate their mastery of a variety of course standards by completing a modified assignment which addresses standards from multiple missed assignments.

## Course Extensions

Students are expected to earn a passing grade (Emerging Proficient or higher) on 65% of the standards within a course. If a student has struggled to demonstrate their mastery of the course content, the student may work with their advisor to submit an application for a Course Extension.

Course extensions are granted to qualifying students who recieve the recommendation of their advisor and submit their application by the deadline. The purpose of a course extension is to allow students to continue their study so that they may demonstrate sufficient mastery of the course to earn a credit.

All UA Maker courses are instructionally annualized, meaning that they are designed for students to achieve mastery in their standards through a 10 month learning cycle. In some cases, courses meet only in the Fall semester. Most students will achieve mastery of standards during that term, however, students may continue to work with their teachers in after school sessions or by completing tasks assigned in Canvas through the rest of the year. Course extensions apply only to students who require time during Term 7 (Summer) to demonstrate their mastery. Courses which meet only during the Fall semester are not eligible for course extensions in the Summer semester.

### Eligibility for Course Extensions

Each year, the school will establish a Course Extensions Review Panel which will include two teachers and a member of the administration or principal's designee. This panel will determine the outcome for all applications for course extensions by offering an extension, declining to offer, or return the application for revision by the student and their advisor.

In determining the status of each application, the panel will be guided by the following criteria:

* Courses that meet only during the fall semester are not eligible for course extensions in the summer term
* Students must have a decaying average of >= advanced beginner and < emerging proficient on 65% of the course standards
* Each student may be granted extensions for up to five of their courses
* Extensions shall be granted only in circumstances where staffing and budgetary considerations make it feasible to do so

The panel shall also consult with the course teacher before finalizing their decision.

### Applying for Course Extensions

Students and their advisor will submit a Course Extension Request google form no later than May 15 for each eligible course a student has not yet passed. The Course Extension Review Panel will return a decision on each application, by email, to both the student and their advisor no later than June 1.

### Accepting a Course Extension Offer

A Course Extension Agreement, signed by the Student and their Advisor, is the official document demonstrating the students acknowledgement of the conditions of their course extension and outlining exactly what they need to do to earn credit for the extended course.

Copies of this agreement will be provided to advisors no later than June 8, and must be signed and returned no later than June 15th. The programming chair shall use completed Course Extension Agreements as the basis for programming students in STARS, and must have the completed agreement in hand prior to taking any action with regard to the course extension in question.

### Award of Credit following a Course Extension

Students who are awarded a course extension in June will be given a score of NU on their June report card. The NU indicates that a course extension has been approved. Students with approved extensions are enrolled in summer school and are given through the summer term (term 7) to complete their course of study. Students in annualized courses will earn 1 credit at the end of term 7 if the student mastered 40% of the standards at a decaying average of emerging proficient or higher and 2 credits if they have mastered 65% of the standards at a decaying average of emerging proficient or higher.
